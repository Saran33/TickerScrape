111,Crop Production,"Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting",,"Industries in the Crop Production subsector grow crops mainly for food and fiber.  The subsector comprises establishments, such as farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in growing crops, plants, vines, or trees and their seeds.

The industries in this subsector are grouped by similarity of production activity, including biological and physiological characteristics and economic requirements, the length of growing season, degree of crop rotation, extent of input specialization, labor requirements, and capital demands.  The production process is typically completed when the raw product or commodity grown reaches the ""farm gate"" for market, that is, at the point of first sale or price determination. 

Establishments are classified in the Crop Production subsector when crop production (i.e., value of crops for market) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment's total agricultural production.  Within the subsector, establishments are classified in a specific industry when a product or industry family of products (i.e., oilseed and grain farming, vegetable and melon farming, fruit and tree nut farming) account for one-half or more of the establishment's agricultural production.  Establishments with one-half or more crop production with no one product or family of products of an industry accounting for one-half of the establishment's agricultural production are treated as general combination crop farming and are classified in Industry 11199, All Other Crop Farming. 

Industries in the Crop Production subsector include establishments that own, operate, and manage and those that operate and manage.  Those that manage only are classified in Subsector 115, Support Activities for Agriculture and Forestry.  Establishments that raise aquatic plants in controlled or selected aquatic environments are classified in Subsector 112, Animal Production and Aquaculture.

113,Forestry and Logging,"Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting",,"Industries in the Forestry and Logging subsector grow and harvest timber on a long production cycle (i.e., of 10 years or more).  Long production cycles use different production processes than short production cycles, which require more horticultural interventions prior to harvest, resulting in processes more similar to those found in the Crop Production subsector.  Consequently, Christmas tree production and other production involving production cycles of less than 10 years, are classified in the Crop Production subsector. 

Industries in this subsector specialize in different stages of the production cycle.  Reforestation requires production of seedlings in specialized nurseries.  Timber production requires natural forest or suitable areas of land that are available for a long duration.  The maturation time for timber depends upon the species of tree, the climatic conditions of the region, and the intended purpose of the timber.  The harvesting of timber (except when done on an extremely small scale) requires specialized machinery unique to the industry.  Establishments gathering forest products, such as gums, barks, balsam needles, rhizomes, fibers, Spanish moss, and ginseng and truffles, are also included in this subsector.

The term ""mining"" is used in the broad sense to include ore extraction, quarrying, and beneficiating (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, sizing, concentrating, and flotation), customarily done at the mine site.

Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles which can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, centrifugal separation, and so on. In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis, distillation, and so on.  However some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both stages: the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages.  The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore deposit.  While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site.

Establishments in the Mining (except Oil and Gas) subsector include those that have complete responsibility for operating mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) and those that operate mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) for others on a contract or fee basis.

238,Specialty Trade Contractors,Construction,,"The Specialty Trade Contractors subsector comprises establishments whose primary activity is performing specific activities (e.g., pouring concrete, site preparation, plumbing, painting, and electrical work) involved in building construction or other activities that are similar for all types of construction, but that are not responsible for the entire project.  The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs.  The production work performed by establishments in this subsector is usually subcontracted from establishments of the general contractor type or for-sale builders, but especially in remodeling and repair construction, work also may be done directly for the owner of the property.  Specialty trade contractors usually perform most of their work at the construction site, although they may have shops where they perform prefabrication and other work.  Establishments primarily engaged in preparing sites for new construction are also included in this subsector.

There are substantial differences in types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by specialty trade contractors.  Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the underlying production function for the specialty trade in which they specialize.  Throughout the Specialty Trade Contractors subsector, establishments commonly provide both the parts and labor required to complete work.  For example, electrical contractors supply the current-carrying and noncurrent-carrying wiring devices that are required to install a circuit.  Plumbing, heating, and air-conditioning contractors also supply the parts required to complete a contract. 

Establishments that specialize in activities primarily related to heavy and civil engineering construction that are not normally performed on buildings, such as the painting of lines on highways, are classified in Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.

Establishments that are primarily engaged in selling construction materials are classified in Sector 42, Wholesale Trade, or Sector 44-45, Retail Trade, based on the characteristics of the selling unit.

312,Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing subsector manufacture beverages and tobacco products.  The Beverage Manufacturing industry group includes three types of establishments: (1) those that manufacture nonalcoholic beverages; (2) those that manufacture alcoholic beverages through the fermentation process; and (3) those that produce distilled alcoholic beverages.  Ice manufacturing, while not a beverage, is included with nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing because it uses the same production process as water purification.

In the case of activities related to the manufacture of beverages, the structure follows the defined production processes.  Brandy, a distilled beverage, is not placed under distillery product manufacturing, but rather under winery product manufacturing since the production process used in the manufacturing of alcoholic grape-based beverages produces both wines (fermented beverage) and brandies (distilled beverage).

The Tobacco Manufacturing industry group includes two types of establishments: (1) those engaged in redrying and stemming tobacco and (2) those that manufacture tobacco products, such as cigarettes and cigars.

313,Textile Mills,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Textile Mills subsector group establishments that transform a basic fiber (natural or synthetic) into a product, such as yarn or fabric that is further manufactured into usable items, such as apparel, sheets, towels, and textile bags for individual or industrial consumption.  The further manufacturing may be performed in the same establishment and classified in this subsector, or it may be performed at a separate establishment and be classified elsewhere in manufacturing. 

The main processes in this subsector include preparation and spinning of fiber, knitting or weaving of fabric, and the finishing of the textile.  The NAICS structure follows and captures this process flow. Major industries in this flow, such as preparation of fibers, weaving of fabric, knitting of fabric, and fiber and fabric finishing, are uniquely identified.  Texturizing, throwing, twisting, and winding of yarn contain aspects of both fiber preparation and fiber finishing and are classified with preparation of fibers rather than with finishing of fibers. 

NAICS separates the manufacturing of primary textiles and the manufacturing of textile products (except apparel) produced from purchased primary textiles, such as fabric.  The manufacturing of textile products (except apparel) from purchased fabric is classified in Subsector 314, Textile Product Mills, and apparel from purchased fabric is classified in Subsector 315, Apparel Manufacturing. 

Excluded from this subsector are establishments that weave or knit fabric and make garments. These establishments are included in Subsector 315, Apparel Manufacturing.

This subsector also includes the manufacture of similar products from other materials, including products (except apparel) made from ""leather substitutes,"" such as rubber, plastics, or textiles.  Rubber footwear, textile luggage, and plastics purses or wallets are examples of ""leather substitute"" products included in this subsector.  The products made from leather substitutes are included in this subsector because they are made in similar ways leather products are made (e.g., luggage).  They are made in the same establishments, so it is not practical to separate them.

The inclusion of leather and hide tanning and finishing in this subsector is partly because it is a relatively small industry that has few close neighbors as a production process, partly because leather is an input to some of the other products classified in this subsector, and partly for historical reasons.

322,Paper Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Paper Manufacturing subsector make pulp, paper, or converted paper products.  The manufacturing of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected processes.  More than one is often carried out in a single establishment.  There are essentially three activities.  The manufacturing of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibers from other impurities in wood or used paper.  The manufacturing of paper involves matting these fibers into a sheet.  The manufacturing of converted paper products involves converting paper and other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques and includes coating and laminating activities.

The Paper Manufacturing subsector is subdivided into two industry groups, the first for the manufacturing of pulp and paper and the second for the manufacturing of converted paper products.  Paper making is treated as the core activity of the subsector.  Therefore, any establishment that makes paper (including paperboard), either alone or in combination with pulp manufacturing or paper converting, is classified as a paper or paperboard mill.  Establishments that make pulp without making paper are classified as pulp mills.  Pulp mills, paper mills and paperboard mills comprise the first industry group.

Establishments that make products from purchased paper and other materials make up the second industry group, Converted Paper Product Manufacturing.  This general activity is then subdivided based, for the most part, on process distinctions.  Paperboard container manufacturing uses corrugating, cutting, and shaping machinery to form paperboard into containers.  Paper bag and coated and treated paper manufacturing establishments cut and coat paper and foil.  Stationery product manufacturing establishments make a variety of paper products used for writing, filing, and similar applications.  Other converted paper product manufacturing includes, in particular, the conversion of sanitary paper stock into such things as tissue paper and disposable diapers. 

An important process used in the Paper Bag and Coated and Treated Paper Manufacturing industry is lamination, often combined with coating.  Lamination and coating make a composite material with improved properties of strength, impermeability, and so on.  The laminated materials may be paper, metal foil, or plastics film. While paper is often one of the components, it is not always.  Lamination of plastics film to plastics film is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, because establishments that do this often first make the film.  The same situation holds with respect to bags.  The manufacturing of bags from plastics only, whether or not laminated, is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, but all other bag manufacturing is classified in this subsector. 

Excluded from this subsector are photosensitive papers.  These papers are chemically treated and are classified in Industry 32599, All Other Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing.

The support activities included here are an integral part of the printing industry, and a product (a printing plate, a bound book, or a computer disk or file) that is an integral part of the printing industry is almost always provided by these operations. 

Processes used in printing include a variety of methods used to transfer an image from a plate, screen, film, or computer file to some medium, such as paper, plastics, metal, textile articles, or wood.  The printing processes employed include, but are not limited to, lithographic, gravure, screen, flexographic, digital, and letterpress. 

In contrast to many other classification systems that locate publishing of printed materials in manufacturing, NAICS classifies the publishing of printed products in Subsector 511, Publishing Industries (except Internet).  Though printing and publishing are often carried out by the same enterprise (a newspaper, for example), it is less and less the case that these distinct activities are carried out in the same establishment.  When publishing and printing are done in the same establishment, the establishment is classified in Sector 51, Information, in the appropriate NAICS industry even if the receipts for printing exceed those for publishing. 

This subsector includes printing on clothing because the production process for that activity is printing, not clothing manufacturing.  For instance, the printing of T-shirts is included in this subsector. In contrast, printing on fabric (or grey goods) is not included.

325,Chemical Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"The Chemical Manufacturing subsector is based on the transformation of organic and inorganic raw materials by a chemical process and the formulation of products.  This subsector distinguishes the production of basic chemicals that comprise the first industry group from the production of intermediate and end products produced by further processing of basic chemicals that make up the remaining industry groups. 

This subsector does not include all industries transforming raw materials by a chemical process.  It is common for some chemical processing to occur during mining operations.  These beneficiating operations, such as copper concentrating, are classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.  Furthermore, the refining of crude petroleum is included in Subsector 324, Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing.  In addition, the manufacturing of aluminum oxide is included in Subsector 331, Primary Metal Manufacturing; and beverage distilleries are classified in Subsector 312, Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing.  As is the case of these two activities, the grouping of industries into subsectors may take into account the association of the activities performed with other activities in the subsector.

326,Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector make goods by processing plastics materials and raw rubber.  The core technology employed by establishments in this subsector is that of plastics or rubber product production.  Plastics and rubber are combined in the same subsector because plastics are increasingly being used as a substitute for rubber; however the subsector is generally restricted to the production of products made of just one material, either solely plastics or rubber. 

Many manufacturing activities use plastics or rubber, for example the manufacture of footwear or furniture.  Typically, the production process of these products involves more than one material. In these cases, technologies that allow disparate materials to be formed and combined are of central importance in describing the manufacturing activity.  In NAICS, such activities (footwear and furniture manufacturing) are not classified in the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector because the core technologies for these activities are diverse and involve multiple materials. 

Within the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector, a distinction is made between plastics and rubber products at the industry group level, although it is not a rigid distinction, as can be seen from the definition of Industry 32622, Rubber and Plastics Hoses and Belting Manufacturing.  As materials technology progresses, plastics are increasingly being used as a substitute for rubber; and eventually, the distinction may disappear as a basis for establishment classification. 

In keeping with the core technology focus of plastics, lamination of plastics film to plastics film as well as the production of bags from plastics only is classified in this subsector.  Lamination and bag production involving plastics and materials other than plastics are classified in Subsector 322, Paper Manufacturing.

327,Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector transforms mined or quarried nonmetallic minerals, such as sand, gravel, stone, clay, and refractory materials, into products for intermediate or final consumption.  Processes used include grinding, mixing, cutting, shaping, and honing.  Heat often is used in the process and chemicals are frequently mixed to change the composition, purity, and chemical properties for the intended product.  For example, glass is produced by heating silica sand to the melting point (sometimes combined with cullet or recycled glass) and then drawn, floated, or blow molded to the desired shape or thickness.  Refractory materials are heated and then formed into bricks or other shapes for use in industrial applications. 

The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector includes establishments that manufacture bricks, refractories, ceramic products, and glass and glass products, such as plate glass and containers.  Also included are cement and concrete products, lime, gypsum and other nonmetallic mineral products including abrasive products, ceramic plumbing fixtures, statuary, cut stone products, and mineral wool.  The products are used in a wide range of activities from construction and heavy and light manufacturing to articles for personal use. 

Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.  Separate receipts will be collected for these activities whenever possible.  When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, beneficiate the nonmetallic minerals, and further process the nonmetallic minerals into a more finished manufactured product are classified based on the primary activity of the establishment.  A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products is classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.  An establishment that mines whose primary output is a more finished manufactured product is classified in the Manufacturing sector. 

Excluded from the Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector are establishments that primarily beneficiate mined nonmetallic minerals.  Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  Beneficiation establishments are included in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.

331,Primary Metal Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector smelt and/or refine ferrous and nonferrous metals from ore, pig or scrap, using electrometallurgical and other process metallurgical techniques.  Establishments in this subsector also manufacture metal alloys and superalloys by introducing other chemical elements to pure metals.  The output of smelting and refining, usually in ingot form, is used in rolling, drawing, and extruding operations to make sheet, strip, bar, rod, or wire, and in molten form to make castings and other basic metal products. 

Primary manufacturing of ferrous and nonferrous metals begins with ore or concentrate as the primary input.  Establishments manufacturing primary metals from ore and/or concentrate remain classified in the primary smelting, primary refining, or iron and steel mill industries regardless of the form of their output.  Establishments primarily engaged in secondary smelting and/or secondary refining recover ferrous and nonferrous metals from scrap and/or dross.  The output of the secondary smelting and/or secondary refining industries is limited to shapes such as ingot or billet that will be further processed.  Recovery of metals from scrap often occurs in establishments that are primarily engaged in activities, such as rolling, drawing, extruding, or similar processes. 

Excluded from the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector are establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing ferrous and nonferrous forgings (except ferrous forgings made in steel mills) and stampings.  Although forging, stamping, and casting are all methods used to make metal shapes, forging and stamping do not use molten metals and are included in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.  Establishments primarily engaged in operating coke ovens are classified in Industry 32419, Other Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing.

332,Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing subsector transform metal into intermediate or end products, other than machinery, computers and electronics, and metal furniture, or treat metals and metal formed products fabricated elsewhere.  Important fabricated metal processes are forging, stamping, bending, forming, and machining, used to shape individual pieces of metal; and other processes, such as welding and assembling, used to join separate parts together.  Establishments in this subsector may use one of these processes or a combination of these processes. 

The NAICS structure for this subsector distinguishes the forging and stamping processes in a single industry.  The remaining industries in the subsector group establishments based on similar combinations of processes used to make products. 

The manufacturing performed in the Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing subsector begins with manufactured metal shapes.  The establishments in this subsector further fabricate the purchased metal shapes into a product.  For instance, the Spring and Wire Product Manufacturing industry starts with wire and fabricates such items. 

Within manufacturing there are other establishments that make the same products made by this subsector; only these establishments begin production further back in the production process.  These establishments have a more integrated operation.  For instance, one establishment may manufacture steel, draw it into wire, and make wire products in the same establishment.

333,Machinery Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Machinery Manufacturing subsector create end products that apply mechanical force, for example, the application of gears and levers, to perform work.  Some important processes for the manufacture of machinery are forging, stamping, bending, forming, and machining that are used to shape individual pieces of metal.  Processes, such as welding and assembling are used to join separate parts together.  Although these processes are similar to those used in metal fabricating establishments, machinery manufacturing is different because it typically employs multiple metal forming processes in manufacturing the various parts of the machine.  Moreover, complex assembly operations are an inherent part of the production process. 

In general, design considerations are very important in machinery production. Establishments specialize in making machinery designed for particular applications.  Thus, design is considered to be part of the production process for the purpose of implementing NAICS.  The NAICS structure reflects this by defining industries and industry groups that make machinery for different applications.  A broad distinction exists between machinery that is generally used in a variety of industrial applications (i.e., general purpose machinery) and machinery that is designed to be used in a particular industry (i.e., special purpose machinery).  Three industry groups consist of special purpose machinery--Agricultural, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing; Industrial Machinery Manufacturing; and Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing.  The other industry groups make general purpose machinery: Ventilation, Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Commercial Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing; Metalworking Machinery Manufacturing; Engine, Turbine, and Power Transmission Equipment Manufacturing; and Other General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing.

334,Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector group establishments that manufacture computers, computer peripherals, communications equipment, and similar electronic products, and establishments that manufacture components for such products.  The Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing industries have been combined in the hierarchy of NAICS because of the economic significance they have attained.  Their rapid growth suggests that they will become even more important to the economies of all three North American countries in the future, and in addition their manufacturing processes are fundamentally different from the manufacturing processes of other machinery and equipment.  The design and use of integrated circuits and the application of highly specialized miniaturization technologies are common elements in the production technologies of the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector.  Convergence of technology motivates this NAICS subsector.  Digitalization of sound recording, for example, causes both the medium (the compact disc) and the equipment to resemble the technologies for recording, storing, transmitting, and manipulating data.  Communications technology and equipment have been converging with computer technology.  When technologically-related components are in the same sector, it makes it easier to adjust the classification for future changes, without needing to redefine its basic structure.  The creation of the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector assists in delineating new and emerging industries because the activities that will serve as the probable sources of new industries, such as computer manufacturing and communications equipment manufacturing, or computers and audio equipment, are brought together.  As new activities emerge, they are less likely to cross the subsector boundaries of the classification.

336,Transportation Equipment Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Transportation Equipment Manufacturing subsector produce equipment for transporting people and goods.  Transportation equipment is a type of machinery.  An entire subsector is devoted to this activity because of the significance of its economic size in all three North American countries. 

Establishments in this subsector utilize production processes similar to those of other machinery manufacturing establishments—bending, forming, welding, machining, and assembling metal or plastic parts into components and finished products.  However, the assembly of components and subassemblies and their further assembly into finished vehicles tends to be a more common production process in this subsector than in the Machinery Manufacturing subsector. 

NAICS has industry groups for the manufacture of equipment for each mode of transport—road, rail, air and water.  Parts for motor vehicles warrant a separate industry group because of their importance and because they require less assembly than complete vehicles. 

Land use motor vehicle equipment not designed for highway operation (e.g., agricultural equipment, construction equipment, and material handling equipment) is classified in the appropriate NAICS subsector based on the type and use of the equipment.

337,Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing,Manufacturing,,"Industries in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector make furniture and related articles, such as mattresses, window blinds, cabinets, and fixtures.  The processes used in the manufacture of furniture include the cutting, bending, molding, laminating, and assembly of such materials as wood, metal, glass, plastics, and rattan.  However, the production process for furniture is not solely bending metal, cutting and shaping wood, or extruding and molding plastics.  Design and fashion trends play an important part in the production of furniture.  The integrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of manufacturing furniture.  Design services may be performed by the furniture establishment's work force or may be purchased from industrial designers.

Furniture may be made of any material, but the most common ones used in North America are metal and wood.  Furniture manufacturing establishments may specialize in making articles primarily from one material.  Some of the equipment required to make a wooden table, for example, is different from that used to make a metal one.  However, furniture is usually made from several materials.  A wooden table might have metal brackets, and a wooden chair a fabric or plastics seat.  Therefore, in NAICS, furniture initially is classified based on the type of furniture (application for which it is designed) rather than the material used.  For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as household furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices. 

When classifying furniture according to the component material from which it is made, furniture made from more than one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant component material.  Upholstered household furniture (excluding kitchen and dining room chairs with upholstered seats) is classified without regard to the frame material.  Kitchen or dining room chairs with upholstered seats are classified according to the frame material.

Furniture may be made on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (i.e., knockdown).  The manufacture of furniture parts and frames is included in this subsector.

Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of manufacturing.  For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in Subsector 321, Wood Product Manufacturing.  However, the multiple processes that distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing warrant inclusion of wooden furniture manufacturing in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector.  Metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacturing of roll formed products classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.  The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products.  However, plastics furniture producing establishments tend to specialize in furniture. 

NAICS attempts to keep furniture manufacturing together, but there are two notable exceptions: seating for transportation equipment and specialized hospital furniture (e.g., hospital beds and operating tables).  These exceptions are related to the fact that some of the aspects of the production process for these products, primarily the design, are highly integrated with the other manufactured goods, namely motor vehicles and medical equipment.

General freight transportation establishments handle a wide variety of general commodities, generally palletized, and transported in a container or van trailer.  Specialized freight transportation is the transportation of cargo that, because of size, weight, shape, or other inherent characteristics, requires specialized equipment for transportation.

The Specialized Freight Trucking industry group includes a separate industry for Used Household and Office Goods Moving. The household and office goods movers are separated because of the substantial network of establishments that has developed to deal with local and long-distance moving and the associated storage.

511,Publishing Industries (except Internet),Information,,"Industries in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector group establishments engaged in the publishing of newspapers, magazines, other periodicals, and books, as well as directory and mailing list and software publishing.  In general, these establishments, which are known as publishers, issue copies of works for which they usually possess copyright.  Works may be in one or more formats including traditional print form, CD-ROM, or proprietary electronic networks.  Publishers may publish works originally created by others for which they have obtained the rights and/or works that they have created in-house.  Software publishing is included here because the activity, creation of a copyrighted product and bringing it to market, is equivalent to the creation process for other types of intellectual products.

In NAICS, publishing--the reporting, writing, editing, and other processes that are required to create an edition of a newspaper--is treated as a major economic activity in its own right, rather than as a subsidiary activity to a manufacturing activity, printing.  Thus, publishing is classified in the Information sector; whereas, printing remains in the Manufacturing sector.  In part, the NAICS classification reflects the fact that publishing increasingly takes place in establishments that are physically separate from the associated printing establishments.  More crucially, the NAICS classification of book and newspaper publishing is intended to portray their roles in a modern economy, in which they do not resemble manufacturing activities.

Music publishers are not included in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector, but are included in the Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector.  Reproduction of prepackaged software is treated in NAICS as a manufacturing activity; on-line distribution of software products is in the Information sector; and custom design of software to client specifications is included in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector.  These distinctions arise because of the different ways that software is created, reproduced, and distributed.

The Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector includes establishments that publish software exclusively on the Internet but excludes establishments that publish other content exclusively on the Internet. Establishments publishing content other than software exclusively on the Internet are included in Subsector 519, Other Information Services.  The Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector also excludes products, such as manifold business forms and appointment books.  Information is not the essential component of these items.  Establishments producing these items are included in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities.

Publishers distribute or arrange for the distribution of these works.

Publishing establishments may create the works in-house, or contract for, purchase, or compile works that were originally created by others.  These works may be published in one or more formats, such as print and/or electronic form, including proprietary electronic networks.  Establishments in this industry may print, reproduce, or offer direct access to the works themselves or may arrange with others to carry out such functions.

Establishments that both print and publish may fill excess capacity with commercial or job printing.  However, the publishing activity is still considered to be the primary activity of these establishments.

512,Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries,Information,,"Industries in the Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector group establishments involved in the production and distribution of motion pictures and sound recordings.  While producers and distributors of motion pictures and sound recordings issue works for sale as traditional publishers do, the processes are sufficiently different to warrant placing establishments engaged in these activities in a separate subsector.  Production is typically a complex process that involves several distinct types of establishments that are engaged in activities, such as contracting with performers, creating the film or sound content, and providing technical postproduction services.  Film distribution is often to exhibitors, such as theaters and broadcasters, rather than through the wholesale and retail distribution chain.  When the product is in a mass-produced form, NAICS treats production and distribution as the major economic activity as it does in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector, rather than as a subsidiary activity to the manufacture of such products.

This subsector does not include establishments primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of video and sound recordings, such as compact discs and audio tapes; these establishments are included in the Wholesale Trade sector.  Reproduction of video and sound recordings that is carried out separately from establishments engaged in production and distribution is treated in NAICS as a manufacturing activity.

The subsector includes two main types of establishments:  (1) those that are engaged in renting consumer goods and equipment and (2) those that are engaged in leasing machinery and equipment often used for business operations.  The first type typically operates from a retail-like or storefront facility and maintains inventories of goods that are rented for short periods of time.  The latter type typically does not operate from retail-like locations or maintain inventories, and offers longer-term leases.  These establishments work directly with clients to enable them to acquire the use of equipment on a lease basis, or they work with equipment vendors or dealers to support the marketing of equipment to their customers under lease arrangements.  Equipment lessors generally structure lease contracts to meet the specialized needs of their clients and use their remarketing expertise to find other users for previously leased equipment.  Establishments that provide operating and capital (i.e., finance) leases are included in this subsector.

Establishments primarily engaged in leasing in combination with providing loans are classified in Sector 52, Finance and Insurance.  Establishments primarily engaged in leasing real property are classified in Subsector 531, Real Estate.  Establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in various subsectors of NAICS depending on the nature of the services provided (e.g., transportation, construction, agriculture).  These activities are excluded from this subsector since the client is paying for the expertise and knowledge of the equipment operator, in addition to the rental of the equipment.  In many cases, such as the rental of heavy construction equipment, the operator is essential to operate the equipment.  Likewise, since the provision of crop harvesting services includes both the equipment and operator, it is included in Subsector 115, Support Activities for Agriculture and Forestry.  The rental or leasing of copyrighted works is classified in Sector 51, Information, and the rental or leasing of assets, such as patents, trademarks, and/or licensing agreements, is classified in Subsector 533, Lessors of Nonfinancial Intangible Assets (except Copyrighted Works).

These establishments make available the knowledge and skills of their employees, often on an assignment basis, where an individual or team is responsible for the delivery of services to the client.  The individual industries of this subsector are defined on the basis of the particular expertise and training of the services provider.

The distinguishing feature of the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services subsector is the fact that most of the industries grouped in it have production processes that are almost wholly dependent on worker skills.  In most of these industries, equipment and materials are not of major importance, unlike health care, for example, where ""high-tech"" machines and materials are important collaborating inputs to labor skills in the production of health care.  Thus, the establishments classified in this subsector sell expertise.  Much of the expertise requires degrees, though not in every case.

The processes employed in this sector (e.g., general management, personnel administration, clerical activities, cleaning activities) are often integral parts of the activities of establishments found in all sectors of the economy.  The establishments classified in this subsector have specialization in one or more of these activities and can, therefore, provide services to clients in a variety of industries and, in some cases, to households.  The individual industries of this subsector are defined on the basis of the particular process that they are engaged in and the particular services they provide.

Many of the activities performed in this subsector are ongoing routine support functions that all businesses and organizations must do and that they have traditionally done for themselves.  Recent trends, however, are to contract or purchase such services from businesses that specialize in such activities and can, therefore, provide the services more efficiently.

The industries in this subsector cannot be viewed as strictly ""support."" The Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services industry group includes travel agents, tour operators, and providers of other travel arrangement services, such as hotel and restaurant reservations and arranging the purchase of tickets, serving many types of clients, including individual consumers.  This group was placed in this subsector because the services are often of the ""support"" nature (e.g., travel arrangement), and businesses and other organizations increasingly purchase such services.

The administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a contract or fee basis.  These activities may also be performed by establishments that are part of the company or enterprise.  However, establishments involved in administering, overseeing, and managing other establishments of the company or enterprise are classified in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises.  Establishments in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises, normally undertake the strategic and organizational planning and decision-making role of the company or enterprise.

711,"Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries","Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation",,"Industries in the Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector group establishments that produce or organize and promote live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, athletes, and other entertainers, including independent (i.e., freelance) entertainers and the establishments that manage their careers.  The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1) producing (i.e., presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and representing entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative and technical skills necessary to the production of these live events.  Also, this subsector contains four industries for performing arts companies.  Each is defined on the basis of the particular skills of the entertainers involved in the presentations.

The industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and performing artists (i.e., independent or freelance).  Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a particularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector.  Distinguishing this activity from the production activity is a meaningful process differentiation.  This approach, however, is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists, especially pop groups.  These establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from freelancers.  For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists.

This subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do not.  This is because there are significant differences in cost structures between those promoters that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and those that do not.  In addition to promoters without facilities, other industries in this subsector include establishments that may operate without permanent facilities.  These types of establishments include performing arts companies; musical groups and artists; spectator sports; and independent (i.e., freelance) artists, writers, and performers.

Excluded from this subsector are nightclubs.  Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a regular basis and it can be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events.  However, since most of these establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not promote entertainment and because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places.

This subsector does not cover all establishments providing recreational services. Other sectors of NAICS also provide recreational services. Providers of recreational services are often engaged in processes classified in other sectors of NAICS.  For example, operators of resorts and hunting and fishing camps provide both accommodation and recreational facilities and services.  These establishments are classified in Subsector 721, Accommodation, partly to reflect the significant costs associated with the provision of accommodation services and partly to ensure consistency with international standards.  Likewise, establishments using transportation equipment to provide recreational and entertainment services, such as those operating sightseeing buses, dinner cruises, or helicopter rides, are classified in Sector 48-49, Transportation and Warehousing.

The industry groups in this subsector highlight particular types of activities: amusement parks and arcades, gambling industries, and other amusement and recreation industries.  The groups, however, are not all-inclusive of the activity.  The Gambling Industries industry group does not provide for full coverage of gambling activities.

811,Repair and Maintenance,Other Services (except Public Administration),,"Industries in the Repair and Maintenance subsector restore machinery, equipment, and other products to working order.  These establishments also typically provide general or routine maintenance (i.e., servicing) on such products to ensure they work efficiently and to prevent breakdown and unnecessary repairs.

The NAICS structure for this subsector brings together most types of repair and maintenance establishments and categorizes them based on production processes (i.e., on the type of repair and maintenance activity performed, and the necessary skills, expertise, and processes that are found in different repair and maintenance establishments).  This NAICS classification does not delineate between repair services provided to businesses versus those that serve households.  Although some industries primarily serve either businesses or households, separation by class of customer is limited by the fact that many establishments serve both.  Establishments repairing computers and consumer electronics products are two examples of such overlap.

The Repair and Maintenance subsector does not include all establishments that do repair and maintenance.  For example, a substantial amount of repair is done by establishments that also manufacture machinery, equipment, and other goods.  These establishments are included in the Manufacturing sector in NAICS.  In addition, repair of transportation equipment is often provided by or based at transportation facilities, such as airports and seaports, and these activities are included in the Transportation and Warehousing sector.  A particularly unique situation exists with repair of buildings.  Plumbing, electrical installation and repair, painting and decorating, and other construction-related establishments are often involved in performing installation or other work on new construction as well as providing repair services on existing structures.  While some specialize in repair, it is difficult to distinguish between the two types and all are included in the Construction sector.

Excluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in rebuilding or remanufacturing machinery and equipment.  These are classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing.  Also excluded are retail establishments that provide after-sale services and repair.  These are classified in Sector 44-45, Retail Trade.
